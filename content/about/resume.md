Originally from Shiraz, Iran, Abe holds a B.Sc. in cellular and molecular biology and M.Sc. in nano-biomimetics from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/), Iran. As the first STEM student in his family, he has honed his computational and experimental skills in molecular and cell biology, functional genomics, systems biology, and gene regulation.

His work includes integrating CRISPR screening and multi-omics datasets to study drug mechanisms in cancer cells. Notably, he developed [ScreenPro2](https://arcinstitute.org/tools/screenpro2), a tool that enables flexible analysis of high-content CRISPR screening datasets. Abe is now a PhD student at the [Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics (PSPG)](https://pspg.ucsf.edu/) program at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).
